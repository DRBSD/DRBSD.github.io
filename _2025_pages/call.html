    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>

    <p>The 11th International Workshop on Data Analysis and Reduction for Big Scientific Data (DRBSD-11)</p>

    <p>Held in conjunction with SC25: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis</p>

    <p>NOV 17, 2025</p>

    <p>ST. LOUIS, MO</p>

    <p>As the speed gap between compute and storage continues to exist and widen, the increasing data volume and velocity pose major challenges for big data applications in terms of storage and analysis. This demands new research and software tools that can further reduce data by several orders of magnitude, taking advantage of new architectures and hardware available on next generation systems. This international workshop on data analysis and reduction is a response to this renewed research direction and will provide a focused venue for researchers in this area to present their research results, exchange ideas, identify new research directions, and foster new collaborations within the community.</p>

    <p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>

    <p>&bull; Data reduction methods for scientific data</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Data deduplication methods</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Motif-specific methods (structured and unstructured meshes, particles, tensors, ...)</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Methods with accuracy guarantees</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Feature/QoI-preserving reduction</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Optimal design of data reduction methods</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Compressed sensing and singular value decomposition</p>

    <p>&bull; Metrics to measure reduction quality and provide feedback</p>

    <p>&bull; Data analysis and visualization techniques that take advantage of the reduced data</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; AI/ML methods</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Surrogate/reduced-order models</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Feature extraction</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Visualization techniques</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Artifact removal during reconstruction</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Methods that take advantage of the reduced data</p>

    <p>&bull; Data analysis and reduction co-design</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Methods for using accelerators</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Accuracy and performance trade-offs on current and emerging hardware</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; New programming models for managing reduced data</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Runtime systems for data reduction</p>

    <p>&bull; Large-scale code coupling and workflows</p>

    <p>&bull; Experience of applying data reduction and analysis in practical applications or use-cases</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; State of the practice</p>

    <p>&ensp;&ensp;&deg; Application use-cases which can drive the community to develop MiniApps</p>
